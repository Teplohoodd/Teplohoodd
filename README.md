- 👋 Hi, I’m @Teplohoodd
- 👀 I'm actually interested in a lot of things, so I'd rather show you the spread: chess, computer games, business, programming, design, sports, music, drawing, mathematics, construction, solving case championships, AI, physics, computer assembly, strategies, reading
- 🌱 Now I'm learning to play the guitar, learning to solve non-standard tasks and improving my python skills. I want to learn a new programming language, but I'm still at a crossroads.
